# A Python Interpreter Written in Python

This is a structure of a Python interpreter written in Python, developed while I was reading <a href="https://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html"><strong>500 lines or less</strong></a>.
It is not working at all, but it was written to deepen my knowlegde of the language and also about <strong>how does a Interpreter works</strong>.
